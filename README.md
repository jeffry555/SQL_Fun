# SQL Fun

The purpose of the repo is to give some example tasks to help learning to use SQL as a programming language.

## Database - MySQL

The example tasks will use MariaDB/MySQL for the database, but most of these solutions will work for most relational databases.

To install MariaDB/MySQL please use the urls: 

You will also want to use an IDE such as Oracle SQL developer or DBeaver.

For each project there will be a database create schema script and an init script for each test set.

The scripts and tests should be run using bash. You should only need to set one environment variable DBXP_BIN to the bin of this repo.

export DBXP_BIN=<path>/SQL_Fun/bin
